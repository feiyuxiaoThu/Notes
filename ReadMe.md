# My Bibliography for Research on Autonomous Driving

## Motivation

In this document, I would like to **share some personal notes** about the latest exciting trends in **research** about decision making for autonomous driving. I keep on updating it :construction_worker: :construction: :smiley:

**Note** The template is stolen from [Simon Chauvin](https://github.com/chauvinSimon/My_Bibliography_for_Research_on_Autonomous_Driving/blob/master/README.md)
